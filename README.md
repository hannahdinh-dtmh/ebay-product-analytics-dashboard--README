An end-to-end data pipeline that scrapes live electronics listings from eBay, preprocesses and classifies the raw data into product families, and surfaces insights through an interactive 5-tab Streamlit dashboard — covering market overview, product analytics, outlier detection, shipping performance, and K-Means clustering.

- **Automated preprocessing** — cleans condition fields, parses seller ratings, classifies shipping types, and extracts numeric cost values
- **Five-tab Streamlit dashboard:**

  - 📊 **Product Analytics** — condition × family heatmap, listing strategy analysis, free-shipping rates, and family deep-dive selector
  - 🔍 **Outlier Detection** — family-aware IQR and Z-score flagging with configurable multipliers, outlier vs normal scatter, and high-value listing table
  - 🚚 **Shipping Analysis** — free vs paid breakdown, cost distributions, price vs shipping scatter, and location analysis
